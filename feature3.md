## Health Insurance Exchange Public Use Files (Exchange PUFs)
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) is committed to increasing transparency 
in the Health Insurance Exchanges. While health plan information including benefits, copayments, premiums, and geographic coverage is publicly available on 
Healthcare.gov, CMS also publishes downloadable public use files (PUFs) so that researchers and other stakeholders can more easily access Exchange data.

The Exchange PUFs consist of twelve separate files as described below:  
1. Benefits and Cost Sharing PUF (BenCS-PUF): Plan variant-level data on essential health benefits, coverage limits, and cost sharing.
2. Rate PUF (Rate-PUF): Plan-level data on rates based on an eligible subscriber’s age, tobacco use, and geographic location; and family-tier rates.
3. Plan Attributes PUF (Plan-PUF): Plan-level data on maximum out of pocket payments, deductibles, HSA eligibility, and other plan attributes.
4. Business Rules PUF (BR-PUF): Plan-level data on rating business rules, such as maximum age for a dependent, and allowed dependent relationships.
5. Service Area PUF (SA-PUF): Issuer-level data on geographic service areas including state, county, and zip code.
6. Network (Ntwrk-PUF): Issuer-level data identifying provider network URLs.
7. Plan ID Crosswalk PUF (CW-PUF): Plan-level data mapping plans offered in the previous plan year to plans offered in the current plan year.
8. Machine-readable URL PUF (MR-PUF): Issuer-level URL locations for machine-readable network provider and formulary information.
9. Transparency in Coverage PUF (TC-PUF): Issuer and plan-level claims, appeals, and active URL data. The PY2025 PUF contains data from PY2023 for 
issuers participating in the Exchanges in PY2023.
10. Quality PUF (Qual-PUF): Quality ratings data for plans offered through the Federally-Facilitated Exchanges. 
The PY2018 through PY2025 PUFs are found [here](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/qualityinitiativesgeninfo/aca-mqi/downloads/mqi-downloads).
11. Nationwide Quality Rating System PUF (NatQRS-PUF): Quality ratings data for plans offered through Exchanges nationwide, including State Based Exchanges (SBE). 
The PY2020 through PY2025 PUFs are found [here](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/qualityinitiativesgeninfo/aca-mqi/downloads/mqi-downloads).
12. Enrollee Survey PUF (ES-PUF): Results from the QHP Enrollee Survey for plans offered through Exchanges nationwide, including State Based Exchanges (SBE). 
The PY2023 and PY2025 PUFs are is found [here](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/qualityinitiativesgeninfo/aca-mqi/downloads/mqi-downloads). 

### Machine-readable URL Public Use File
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) publishes the Exchange PUFs to improve transparency and increase access to data on Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and Stand-alone Dental Plans (SADPs) offered through the Exchanges in the individual market and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). The PUFs include data from states with Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) including states performing plan management 
functions, and State-based Exchanges that rely on the federal information technology platform for QHP eligibility and enrollment (SBE-FPs). The Exchange PUFs also include data on Multi-State Plans (MSPs) and certified off-exchange SADPs. The PUFs do not include data from SBEs that do not rely on the 
federal platform for QHP eligibility and enrollment. The Machine-readable URL PUF (MR-PUF) is one of the files that comprise the Exchange PUFs. The MR-PUF contains issuer-level data identifying machine-readable index URLs that lead to the issuer’s provider, formulary, and plan JSON URLs. These data originate from an issuer’s submission in the Marketplace Plan Management System (MPMS) or were generated by CCIIO for use in data processing (i.e., system-generated).This data dictionary describes the variables contained in the MR-PUF. Each record reports an issuer’s machine-readable index URL and technical point of contact. The MR-PUF is available for plan years 2016 through 2025.
