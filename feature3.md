## Health Insurance Exchange Public Use Files (Exchange PUFs)
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) is committed to increasing transparency 
in the Health Insurance Exchanges. While health plan information including benefits, copayments, premiums, and geographic coverage is publicly available on 
Healthcare.gov, CMS also publishes downloadable public use files (PUFs) so that researchers and other stakeholders can more easily access Exchange data.

The Exchange PUFs consist of twelve separate files as described below:  
1. Benefits and Cost Sharing PUF (BenCS-PUF): Plan variant-level data on essential health benefits, coverage limits, and cost sharing.
2. Rate PUF (Rate-PUF): Plan-level data on rates based on an eligible subscriber’s age, tobacco use, and geographic location; and family-tier rates.
3. Plan Attributes PUF (Plan-PUF): Plan-level data on maximum out of pocket payments, deductibles, HSA eligibility, and other plan attributes.
4. Business Rules PUF (BR-PUF): Plan-level data on rating business rules, such as maximum age for a dependent, and allowed dependent relationships.
5. Service Area PUF (SA-PUF): Issuer-level data on geographic service areas including state, county, and zip code.
6. Network (Ntwrk-PUF): Issuer-level data identifying provider network URLs.
7. Plan ID Crosswalk PUF (CW-PUF): Plan-level data mapping plans offered in the previous plan year to plans offered in the current plan year.
8. Machine-readable URL PUF (MR-PUF): Issuer-level URL locations for machine-readable network provider and formulary information.
9. Transparency in Coverage PUF (TC-PUF): Issuer and plan-level claims, appeals, and active URL data. The PY2025 PUF contains data from PY2023 for 
issuers participating in the Exchanges in PY2023.
10. Quality PUF (Qual-PUF): Quality ratings data for plans offered through the Federally-Facilitated Exchanges. 
The PY2018 through PY2025 PUFs are found [here](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/qualityinitiativesgeninfo/aca-mqi/downloads/mqi-downloads).
11. Nationwide Quality Rating System PUF (NatQRS-PUF): Quality ratings data for plans offered through Exchanges nationwide, including State Based Exchanges (SBE). 
The PY2020 through PY2025 PUFs are found [here](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/qualityinitiativesgeninfo/aca-mqi/downloads/mqi-downloads).
12. Enrollee Survey PUF (ES-PUF): Results from the QHP Enrollee Survey for plans offered through Exchanges nationwide, including State Based Exchanges (SBE). 
The PY2023 and PY2025 PUFs are is found [here](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality-initiatives-patient-assessment-instruments/qualityinitiativesgeninfo/aca-mqi/downloads/mqi-downloads). 

### Machine-readable URL Public Use File
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) publishes the Exchange PUFs to improve transparency and increase access to data on Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and Stand-alone Dental Plans (SADPs) offered through the Exchanges in the individual market and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). The PUFs include data from states with Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) including states performing plan management 
functions, and State-based Exchanges that rely on the federal information technology platform for QHP eligibility and enrollment (SBE-FPs). The Exchange PUFs also include data on Multi-State Plans (MSPs) and certified off-exchange SADPs. The PUFs do not include data from SBEs that do not rely on the 
federal platform for QHP eligibility and enrollment. The Machine-readable URL PUF (MR-PUF) is one of the files that comprise the Exchange PUFs. The MR-PUF contains issuer-level data identifying machine-readable index URLs that lead to the issuer’s provider, formulary, and plan JSON URLs. These data originate from an issuer’s submission in the Marketplace Plan Management System (MPMS) or were generated by CCIIO for use in data processing (i.e., system-generated).This data dictionary describes the variables contained in the MR-PUF. Each record reports an issuer’s machine-readable index URL and technical point of contact. The MR-PUF is available for plan years 2016 through 2025.

#### Machine Readable Data
Issuers seeking certification to offer QHPs on the Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) are required to submit provider and formulary data in a machine-readable 
format to CMS and for posting on issuer websites. CMS’s machine-readable data initiative provides a structured and predictable dataset that supports the function 
of HealthCare.gov’s Decision Support Tools, and is used by third-party application developers and researchers. HealthCare.gov and its Direct Enrollment partner 
websites use machine-readable data to allow consumers to filter available QHPs based on the providers and drugs covered by those QHPs.  

QHP issuers on the FFE are required to create a set of machine-readable data files using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format specified by CMS. 
There are four types of machine-readable data files: 

1. Index files, which are used to organize and find the other file types.
2. Plans files, which contain information on the QHPs offered by the issuer.
3. **Provider files, which contain information identifying each participating provider in the issuer’s network.**
4. Drugs or formulary files, which contain information about the drugs covered by the QHPs offered by the issuer.

#### My comments to the providers' schema
**Current Schema Behavior**
1. **Multiple Addresses:** The individual definition allows for multiple addresses.
2. **Multiple Plans:** The individual definition also allows for multiple plans.
3. **Global accepting Property:** The accepting property is defined at the practitioner level, not at the address or plan level.  

**This setup implies that:**
1. **Acceptance for New Patients** (accepting) applies globally to the practitioner and does not account for variability across addresses or plans.
2. It is not possible to specify that a particular address accepts new patients for only a subset of the plans.

**Implications**
The schema lacks the granularity to represent cases where:
1. A specific address accepts new patients only for certain plans.
2. Another address may accept new patients for all plans.
If any address or plan has a different acceptance status, it cannot be captured accurately.

**Potential Solution**
To address this limitation, the schema could be modified to include the accepting status at a more granular level.  
1. Associate plans with address
```
"addresses": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "address": {
                "type": "string",
                "minLength": 1
            },
            "plans": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "plan_id": { "type": "string" },
                        "accepting": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "enum": [
                                "accepting",
                                "not accepting",
                                "accepting in some locations",
                                ""
                            ]
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["plan_id", "accepting"]
                }
            }
        },
        "required": ["address"]
    },
    "minItems": 1
}

```

2. Create a separate array that links address, plans and their repective acceptance statuses.
```
"address_plan_mappings": {
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "address": { "type": "string" },
            "plan_id": { "type": "string" },
            "accepting": {
                "type": "string",
                "enum": [
                    "accepting",
                    "not accepting",
                    "accepting in some locations",
                    ""
                ]
            }
        },
        "required": ["address", "plan_id", "accepting"]
    }
}

```
