## Practitioner and Organization Relationship

To ensure data accuracy based on mutual attestation, we can implement logic that validates the agreement between a practitioner and an organization before inserting the relationship into the database. This can be achieved by creating a **staging table** for unverified relationships and adding a **stored procedure** that validates mutual attestation.
